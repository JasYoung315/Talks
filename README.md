Talks
=====

A repository for my talks

The `serve.py` file automatically generates the `index.html` file that is served using [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).
I wrote a blog post about it [here](http://drvinceknight.github.io/unpeudemath/code/2014/07/19/Using-Python-and-Github-pages-to-distribute-my-conference-talks/).
